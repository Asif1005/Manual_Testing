# Dynamic Search Feature Testing - Evershop

## Overview
This repository contains my work on testing the implementation of a dynamic search feature for a shoe-selling e-commerce platform.  
The client requested a search function that supports dynamic keyword matching, partial matches, and specific text queries.  
My work includes requirement analysis (questions to the client), test case design, and execution of tests on the Evershop demo site.

---

## Objectives
- Understand the search feature requirements from the client.
- Design relevant test cases based on requirements.
- Execute test cases on the provided Evershop demo site.
- Document the results in a structured report.

---

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Requirement Gathering
- Prepared **10 priority-based questions** for the client to clarify the search feature expectations.
- Focused on search type, filters, case sensitivity, special characters, and performance.

### 2. Test Case Writing
- Designed **detailed test cases** based on the clarified requirements.
- Covered **positive**, **negative**, and **edge-case** scenarios.

### 3. Test Execution
- Executed all test cases on the **Evershop demo site**: [https://demo.evershop.io/](https://demo.evershop.io/).
- Documented results with **Pass/Fail status**, **observations**, and any **bugs found**.

### 4. Reporting
- Created a **final test execution report** with screenshots and detailed issue descriptions.
